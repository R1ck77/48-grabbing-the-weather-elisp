## Exercise 48: Grabbing the Weather

Elisp solution of exercise 48 from "Exercises for Programmers" by Brian P. Hogan.

The basic goal and a couple of challenges have been solved (I found the remaining ones boring and/or trivial).

### Usage

You need an [openWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API key in order to use the software: save it as the first line of ``apikey.txt`` (no extra spaces or characters on that line!).

Eval ``debug.el``: it adds the current path to the package search path and requires the ``weather.el`` module, then execute the command ``M-x weather``.

Keep your expectations low.

Thanks to OpenWeatherMap for making their service freely available with such permissive conditions.
